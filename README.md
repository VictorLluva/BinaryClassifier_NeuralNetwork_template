# NeuralNetwork_BinaryClassifier__template
This is a template for building a simple Binary Classifier Neural Networks using pandas, keras and tensorflow

- Prediction Output: binary (0/1)
- Split into train and test datasets: YES
- Model used: Keras sequential (see more at: https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/)
- Activation functions: for the inner layers (relu), for the output layers (sigmoid)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: binary_crossentropy
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy and recall
- Summary of prediction cases: included

You can use this template to expand in complexity or add more code. Good luck.
